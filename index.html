    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is Elfan, a self-taught UI Designer from Indonesia with 2 years of experience and still growing.</p>
    <p>My journey began in 2020 when everyone was required to stay at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>I used that time to explore myself, learning various skills such as coding and content creation, until I discovered the field I love and have been dedicated to ever since, UI design.</p>
    <p>Throughout my journey, I have helped design websites, apps, and social media for clients ranging from local (Indonesia) to international (Germany, the UK, the US, and Argentina).</p>
    <p>If you'd like to collaborate with me or just have a coffee chat, feel free to connect at <a href="mailto:@melfanza1804@gmail.com">melfanza1804@gmail.com!</a></p>
